I've been hearing similar statements a lot, and there is some legitimacy to
them: After all, how come there needs to be so much strange terminology? I can
only speculate as to why it was introduced, but from my (admittedly quite
short) experience working with multiple companies big and small, I think the
reasoning may be as follows:

Pretend for a moment that we didn't have those terms and the Scrum Guide was
speaking about. Instead of "Daily Scrum", it was just "Daily Meeting" or some
other, similarly inocuous term. For a team already practicing Scrum, nothing
would change by calling it that.

However consider a team that works in a completely different process, but also
has something called a "Daily Meeting" that might happen at different times
during the day.  This "Daily Meeting" is 30 minutes long and concerns topics
like new technologies that might be introduced in the project or project
specific company politics. What will happen if this team tries to adopt Scrum? 

Well, we are going to have a problem there.

In theoretical make-believe fantasy land, the issue gets raised, the involved
parties realize that there is a naming conflict between two fundamentally
different meetings and find a sensible way of handling it like renaming one of
the meetings.

In reality, there are some less-than-ideal things that may happen:

  * "We already have a Daily Meeting, right? So I guess we are already doing
    this and don't need to change anything?" (Non-Adoption)
  * "We already have a Daily Meeting but the content is different than what the
    Scrum Guide says. So let's do both in one meeting." (Mixing)
  * "Since the Scrum guide says a Daily Meeting has to be about $topic, we are
    now canceling the old daily meeting because it was not about $topic"
    (Replacement)

Even if you team does not already have a "Daily Meeting", consider what happens
as time goes on: People on the team forget that your "Daily Meeting" was
introduced as part of something called Scrum and has a very clear definition
and purpose. Over time it might happen that it becomes something else. After
all: "Who are you to tell me what a 'Daily Meeting' is supposed to be like?

By having a name like "Daily Scrum", all of these problems are avoided: Since
the Scrum Guide invents the term, it can define its meaning clearly and
unambiguously. No naming clashes and no lack of clarity.

So in summary, Scrum having this weird culty lingo is just meant to allow your
team to distance itself from preconceived notions about what certain words may
mean and gives you a blank slate with clear definitions to start with.

One implication of this is that you don't actually need to adopt any of this
terminology to practice a process that is in all relevant aspects like Scrum.

Getting together with your team once every other week to think about what the
problems were last week and how one might go about tackling them does not need
to be __called__ a "Sprint Retrospective" it just needs to __be__ one.
